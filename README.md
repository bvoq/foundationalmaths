# Some foundational mathematics

This was mostly an attempt to summarize the foundations of mathematics. It kind of failed due to the scope of it.

Not missing: Propositional logic, predicate logic, a little bit of proof theory, group theory.

Missing: Type theory, category theory, theory of computation, any kind of higher mathematics (linear algebra, analysis, function theory,...), other types of logic (fuzzy, paraconsistent logics, ...)

I don't plan to continue this.
